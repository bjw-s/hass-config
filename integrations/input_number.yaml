# The input_number integration allows the user to define values that can be 
# controlled via the frontend and can be used within conditions of automation. 
# The frontend can display a slider, or a numeric input box. 
# Changes to the slider or numeric input box generate state events. 
# These state events can be utilized as automation triggers as well
